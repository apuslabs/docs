## Introduction

Hello builders, and welcome to the AO Hackathon!

At APUS, our mission is to enable verifiable decentralized AI of the AO ecosystem by integrating deterministic GPU computing. We believe that by providing direct, on-chain access to accelerated computing, we unlock the next generation of autonomous agentsâ€”making them more intelligent, capable, and powerful than ever before.

For this hackathon, we are thrilled to introduce our flagship product: the **APUS AI Inference Service**. This service gives your AO processes the ability to call a large language model and receive a response, all through a simple, on-chain message. Inspired by the simplicity and elegance of community projects like `llama-herder` [https://github.com/permaweb/llama-herder](https://github.com/permaweb/llama-herder), our service is designed to be incredibly easy to use, so you can focus on building amazing things.

This guide will walk you through everything from making your first AI call to integrating our service into a full-stack dApp. Let's get started!

## Quick Start In 5 Minutes

1. **Install aos**
    
    ```jsx
    npm i -g https://preview_ao.arweave.net
    ```
    
2. **Spawn your process & trust APUS HyperBEAM Node**
    1. Open your terminal
    2. Spawn your process: 
        
        ```jsx
        aos my_process
        ```
        
    3. Trust apus node operator: 
        
        ```jsx
        ao.authorities[2] = "lpJ5Edz_8DbNnVDL0XdbsY9vCOs45NACzfI4jvo4Ba8"
        ```
        
3. Install APM & APUS Lua Lib
    1. Install APM: 
        
        ```jsx
        .load-blueprint apm
        ```
        
    2. Wait for APM Loaded (about 2 minutes)
        
        ![image.png](/sdk/images/image.png)
        
        *Note: Please wait for the `APM client loaded` logs to load. If it do not appear after a long time, try entering any command in the AOS console to check if the system is stuck.*
        
    3. Install Lua Lib: 
        
        ```jsx
        apm.install "@apus/ai"
        ```
        
    4. Wait for Lua Lib Installed
        
        ![image.png](/sdk/images/image1.png)
        
        *Note: Download may take a while. Please wait.*
        
4. Get your credits
    1. You have 5 default test credits, allowing up to 5 inference calls.
    2. Apply more credits:(Recommend)
        1. Join APUS Discord: [LINK_TO_DISCORD_HERE]
        2. Go to theÂ `#ðŸ“¥ï½œapply-hackathon-incentive`Â channel.
        3. Submit Your Application :
            
            **ðŸ§ª Sample Application Format**
            
            ```jsx
            Project Name: MyChatAgent
            Description: A Chat AI Agent built using the APUS SDK
            GitHub Repo: <https://github.com/xxx/xxx>
            Twitter Handle:xxxx
            Process ID: process_3rrphxxxxxx
            Wallet Address: abc123â€¦
            Application Type: Plan A (Free Credits) / Plan B (Token Rebate)
            ```
            
5. Reconnect your process to APUS HyperBEAM Node & Run AI Inference
    1. Reconnect your process to APUS HyperBEAM Node
        ```jsx
        aos my_process --mainnet http://72.46.85.207:8734
        ```
        
    2. Load AI Lib
        
        ```lua
        ApusAI = require('@apus/ai')
        ```
        
    3. Set `ApusAI_Debug` to enable inference result logging. If unset, no logs will be shown. 
        
        ```jsx
        ApusAI_Debug = true
        ```
        
    
    Check your balance
    
    > **Default balance: 5,000,000,000,000 units (equals 5 credits for 5 inference calls). Credits are non-transferable.**
    > 
    
    ```lua
    ApusAI.getBalance()
    ```
    
    1. Run AI Inference: *it takes about 50s*
        
        ```lua
        ApusAI.infer("What is Arweave?")
        ```
        
    2. Wait for AI Response
