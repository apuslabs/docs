# 🚀 Showcase

Congratulations! You have successfully run your first AI inference call. Now, let's demonstrate how to build a real AI chat application through a complete project example.

## 📋 Project Overview

**APUS Chat Attestation Example** is a complete full-stack application example that demonstrates how to:
- Deploy AI chat agents on the AO network
- Integrate APUS AI inference services
- Build frontend interfaces to interact with AO agents
- Implement message attestation and verification mechanisms

## 🔧 Core Components Analysis

### 1. AO Agent (`ao_agent.lua`)
This is a smart contract deployed on the AO network, responsible for:
- Receiving user messages
- Calling APUS AI inference services
- Generating AI responses
- Handling message attestation

**Key Features**:
- Uses APUS AI library for inference
- Implements message queue management
- Supports message attestation and verification
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 2. Frontend Application
User interface built with React, providing:
- Chat interface
- AO Connect integration
- Message sending and receiving
- Real-time status updates

## 🎯 Developer Learning Guide

### Phase 1: Understanding AO Agent Architecture

**Learning Objective**: Master the basic structure of AO Agent and APUS AI integration methods

**Key Code Snippets**:
```lua

-- Core logic for handling messages
Handlers.message = function(msg)
    -- 1. Validate message format
    -- 2. Call AI inference
    -- 3. Generate response
    -- 4. Send response
end
```

**Learning Points**:
1. **Message Processing Flow**: Understand how AO Agent receives, processes, and responds to messages
2. **AI Integration Pattern**: Learn how to elegantly integrate APUS AI services
3. **State Management**: Master AO Agent's state management mechanisms
4. **Error Handling**: Understand error handling and retry strategies

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration Patterns

**Learning Objective**: Master how frontend interacts with AO Agent

**Key Concepts**:
1. **AO Connect**: Learn how to connect to AO network
2. **Message Sending**: Learn how to send messages to AO Agent
3. **Response Handling**: Master how to handle AI responses
4. **State Synchronization**: Understand frontend state synchronization with AO Agent

### Phase 3: Project Customization Development

**Development Steps**:

1. **Project Initialization**
   ```bash
   # Clone example project
   git clone https://github.com/apuslabs/apus-chat-attestation-example
